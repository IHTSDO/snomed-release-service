The linkage table held in the language refset in file “rel2_cRefset_MedicalDevicesLanguageDelta-en_INT_20140731.txt” has been removed from the Release.

This was due to the following:

1. a lack of clear guidance from the EPG
2. the invalid format of the linkage table
3. the invalid usage of a language refset to represent the required linkage table

This was discussed and agreed between Robert and Andrew on 19/09/2014.

Andrew subsequently removed the file from the packaging of the ZIP file, and amended the Release Notes accordingly, removing all references to this refset (see the file named “doc_SnomedCTMedicalDevicesReleaseNotes_Current-en-US_INT_20140731 (original).docx” for the original wording).
